# Venmo - A Case Study

## Overview and Origin

What originally started as a music startup which would allow its users to send a text to a band and have an mp3 emailed to them^1^ had a momentus pivot in 2009 when its  founders, Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail experienced a difficult way to pay friends back with cash or checks. They thought that these types of transactions were able to be done with something like Paypal but no one they knew was using that service for P2P transactions which they attributed to the Paypal experience so they set out to build something that “felt right” ^2^.
They went through 3 rounds of funding between the years of 2009-2011 ultimately securing $1.3M^3^ before being acquired in 2012 by Braintree for $26.5 million dollars. Subsequently Ebay’s then Paypal acquired Braintree in 2013 for $800 million dollars.


## Business Activities
By developing a social component and easier to use interface, Venmo has been able to allow its P2P users to pay each other from their mobile phones without charging any fees so long as it’s from a linked bank account, debit card or their Venmo balance. If the user links it to a credit card, Venmo charges a 3% transaction fee. In addition to this fee, Venmo also charges merchants a 2.9% +.30 per transaction fee.  There have been suggestions to turn this social network into a potential revenue generator by possibly providing ads to its users based on their activity but Venmo has notably decided not to turn that monetization method yet. The Venmo development stack consists of several languages, frameworks, libraries such as Python, JQuery,Php, Swift and others.^4^ Their engineering blog doesn’t appear to have been updated in a while however it lists several open-source libraries and tools that they use to develop Venmo.
According to Fortune Business Insights, "The global mobile payment market size stood at USD 1.18 trillion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 8.94 trillion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 29.0% during the forecast period".^5^ Venmo has managed to be a leading solution for millennials as Venmo user demographics indicate that about 7.4 million P2P payment service’s users are aged between 18 and 34. Among those, 4.1 million belong in the 25-34 age group, while 3.3 million are 18-24. Only 1.4 million Venmo consumers are aged 35-44. Americans from the 45-54 and over 55 age groups represent 1.4 million users or about 700,000 consumers each. If you add up these numbers, it turns out that Venmo had approximately 10.2 million users back in 2017.^6^


## Landscape:
Prior to Venmo some people would utilize Paypal for similar transactions but the adoption rate by users was low in comparison to Venmo which can be attributed to their social network which allows a user to see what friends are sending money to each other for. There has been an increase in the number of mobile payment providers in the last few years such as CashApp, ApplePay, GooglePay, SamsungPay, Zelle to name a few.  Some of these competitors offer services that Venmo doesn’t offer such as in-store purchasing.


## Results

Venmo has achieved a coveted feat which many businesses would want; to be utilized as a verb. It’s commonplace for its users to state, “I’ll Venmo you for that.”  In the second quarter of 2020, Venmo’s net payment volume amounted to 37 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 52 percent year-on-year growth. The company had more than 40 million active accounts at the end of the first quarter of 2019 ^6^ Compared to its peers Venmo is the largest^7^ P2P when measured by annual active users. 


## Recommendations

There are a few areas where we would like to see Venmo venture into:

Venmo should consider providing a way for the user to invest in stocks, bitcoin  by allowing the user to defer a percentage of the total amount of transactions the user sends out every month be transferred into a Venmo investing account.  This would not only allow Venmo to compete with CashApp in that regard.

Venmo could also provide loans by allowing it’s users to invest in local businesses that are seeking loans from Venmo. Venmo would act as an intermediary and showcase these loans that local businesses are looking for and can determine the rate but instead of funding these loans themselves they would allow it’s users to fund the loans. Providing a way for its users to invest into local businesses in their neighborhoods or other neighborhoods. Venmo would utilize its platform to manage the processing of the loans and charge the users that are investing a fee and or a percentage of the gain on the loan.

Additionally Venmo should take advantage of their large user base and provide a gig marketplace where their users can find ways to make extra cash. This would allow their user base to post projects and interact with people outside of their network as well as provide additional fees for Venmo by either charging the user taking on the gig a nominal fee. Venmo should continue to build-out these potential additional features using the same development stack they’ve used so far.
